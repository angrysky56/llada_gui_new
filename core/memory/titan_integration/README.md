# Titan Memory Integration for LLaDA GUI

This module provides direct integration between the LLaDA diffusion model and the MCP Titan Memory system.

## Overview

The Titan Memory integration offers several advantages over the standard memory server-based approach:

1. **Direct Integration**: Works directly within the Python process without requiring an external server
2. **Improved Performance**: Eliminates network overhead for memory operations
3. **Enhanced Reliability**: No dependency on external processes or port availability
4. **Better Diffusion Guidance**: Finer-grained control over token probabilities during the diffusion process
5. **Persistence**: Memory models can be saved and loaded directly

## Architecture

The integration consists of several components:

- **TitanMemoryGuidance**: Core class that interfaces with the diffusion process
- **MemoryGuidedDiffusionWorker**: Worker thread for memory-guided generation
- **TitanMemoryModel**: Neural memory model for context tracking and coherence
- **TitanMemorySystem**: High-level interface for managing the memory system

## Memory Guidance Mechanism

During the diffusion process, the Titan Memory integration:

1. Tracks the evolving token sequence
2. Updates an internal memory state based on the sequence
3. Predicts likely next tokens based on memory context
4. Adjusts token probabilities to favor contextually appropriate choices
5. Learns from generated text to improve future generations

## Usage

The integration is used automatically when the "Use Memory Guidance" option is enabled in the GUI. You can also control the memory influence through the "Memory Influence" slider in the Memory tab.

## Training

The memory system can be trained on your generations to improve coherence and contextual awareness:

1. Generate text with the model
2. Go to the Memory tab 
3. Click "Train on Last Generation"
4. The memory will learn from the prompt-generation pair

## Customization

You can customize the memory system by:

1. Saving and loading memory models
2. Adjusting the memory influence weight
3. Using the Reset button to clear memory state

## Implementation Details

The Titan Memory system uses a neural network to maintain a compressed representation of context. The system:

- Embeds token sequences into a continuous vector space
- Updates a memory state using recurrent connections
- Predicts future tokens based on the memory state and current tokens
- Provides guidance rather than direct output, complementing the diffusion process
